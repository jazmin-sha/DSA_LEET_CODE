Namaste DSA – Back to Basics
I’m a Full Stack Developer with 5 years of experience, mainly working with JavaScript, Angular, and Node.js.
Even with industry experience, I believe it’s important to revisit the basics and strengthen my problem-solving skills.
This repository is my space to:
Re-learn JavaScript fundamentals from the ground up
Practice Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) through the Namaste DSA course
Build consistency with daily warmups and problem-solving
🎯 Why I Started This
After years in real-world development, I realized:
Strong DSA knowledge is key for growth and scaling up in tech
Solving problems from scratch keeps the mind sharp
Learning is a continuous process, no matter the experience
🛠️ Tech & Tools
Language: JavaScript
Focus: From basics → DSA → problem-solving patterns
Course Reference: Namaste DSA
👉 This repo is not about showing perfection, but about documenting the journey of sharpening my fundamentals again.
